# Sample Dataset for STRIDE Prototype

This folder contains a simplified example dataset used to demonstrate the STRIDE framework's ontology-based data integration and reasoning capabilities.

## Contents

- **sensor_data.csv** – Simulated IoT sensor readings (e.g., temperature, energy consumption)
- **component_metadata.csv** – Metadata of building components from BIM or COBie sources
- **performance_thresholds.csv** – Predefined thresholds for triggering anomaly detection
- **task_mapping.csv** – Mapping rules for converting anomaly types into maintenance tasks

## Purpose

These files support the evaluation of STRIDE's ability to:
- Ingest heterogeneous datasets
- Detect anomalies based on threshold logic
- Automatically generate maintenance tasks
- Visualize and trace data relationships via Neo4j

## License

This dataset is provided for academic and review purposes only.
