# Python Sample Scripts for STRIDE

This folder contains optional Python scripts used to simulate semantic reasoning and automation logic demonstrated in the STRIDE prototype.

## Scripts Overview

- `Generate Anomaly Data.py`  
  Generate synthetic sensor data and inject labeled anomalies.

- `Generate MaintenanceTask.py`  
  Create maintenance task nodes triggered by anomaly conditions.

- `Generate_TRIGGERS.py`  
  Link anomalies to maintenance tasks using the `[:TRIGGERS]` relationship.

These scripts support the reasoning workflows described in Listing 1 and Listing 2 of the manuscript.
