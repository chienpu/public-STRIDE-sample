# STRIDE Sample Repository for Journal Review

This repository contains selected artifacts from the **STRIDE (Semantic Task-Driven Reasoning and Integration for Data-Driven Engineering)** framework. It supports journal peer review by demonstrating the core concepts of ontology-driven predictive maintenance using Neo4j and Python.

> 🔒 This is a **public sample**. Proprietary and full-scale datasets are omitted for privacy and intellectual property considerations.

## 🧠 Core Concepts Demonstrated

- **Ontology Schema (Neo4j Data Importer)**: Sample schema for mapping assets, sensors, and anomalies.
- **RDF-style Conceptual Alignment**: Visualization of STRIDE’s compatibility with RDF/OWL.
- **Python Reasoning Script**: Automates anomaly detection from mock sensor logs.
- **BPMN Diagram**: Describes collaborative ontology development process.
- **Framework Overview Images**: Visual breakdown of STRIDE components and evolution.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **View ontology schema**: See `ontology/neo4j_importer_model_sample.json`
2. **Explore RDF-style alignment**: Check `images/STRIDE_RDF_graph.png`
3. **Run logic**: Examine `python/Anomaly_Reasoning_Sample.py` (no external dependencies)
4. **Load sample data**: Browse `data-sample/*.csv` (e.g., sensors, anomalies)
5. **Refer to architecture**: Open diagrams in `images/` folder
